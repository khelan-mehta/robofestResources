            <h2>Step 1: Advanced Onshape Workspace Setup and Configuration</h2>
            <p>Onshape is a professional-grade, cloud-based Computer-Aided Design (CAD) platform that offers parametric modeling capabilities essential for creating precise, manufacturable rover components. Unlike traditional desktop CAD software, Onshape provides real-time collaboration, version control, and cross-platform accessibility, making it ideal for autonomous vehicle development projects.</p>

                <h4>Why Choose Onshape for Autonomous Rover Development?</h4>
                <p>Onshape's cloud-native architecture ensures your designs are always backed up and accessible from any device. The parametric modeling approach allows for rapid design iterations‚Äîcrucial when optimizing rover performance. The integrated PDM (Product Data Management) system tracks all design changes, enabling you to revert to previous versions if needed during testing phases.</p>

                <strong>Manufacturing Excellence Insight:</strong> Quality cannot be inspected into a product - it must be built in through proper process design, training, and control. Invest time in process development to achieve consistent, high-quality results from the start.

                <strong>Cost Optimization Strategy:</strong> Optimize the total cost of ownership, not just initial manufacturing cost. Consider assembly time, maintenance requirements, and lifecycle costs when making manufacturing decisions. Sometimes a higher initial cost yields lower total costs.

                <strong>Testing Philosophy:</strong> Test early, test often, and test realistically. Laboratory testing provides controlled conditions for baseline performance, but field testing under actual operational conditions reveals issues that laboratory testing cannot predict. Always validate performance under worst-case scenarios.

            <div class="tip">
                <strong>Optimization Strategy:</strong> Optimization is an iterative process. Start with the largest performance limiters and work systematically through smaller improvements. Document all changes and their effects to build institutional knowledge for future projects.

            <div class="warning">
                <strong>Safety Validation Critical:</strong> Never compromise safety for performance. Emergency stop systems, overcurrent protection, and thermal protection must function reliably under all conditions. Test safety systems regularly and maintain them according to manufacturer recommendations.
